            <p>
                Driven individual with a passion for personal growth and continuing to learn as much as possible.
        
                I have spent the last five years as a part of the customer service and hospitality industry in various management positions while putting myself through school both at the University of Central Florida and Seminole State College. After having graduated from Seminole State with a 3.7 GPA and my Associate in Arts Degree, I fell in love with computer programming.
                
                I was accepted into the UCF Coding Boot-camp where my computer programming and web development skills were increased and expanded my general knowledge-base of coding. 
                
                Excited to continue my education and eventually achieve my Bachelors in Computer Science.
